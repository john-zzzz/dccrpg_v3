The swarm is large enough to distract nearby creatures within 10', both friend and foe (DC 8 Will save or -1 to all rolls for one round), though the caster is immune. If this result is rolled a third time, the swarm of flies follows the caster constantly, day and night, whether he is casting spells or doing something else."

Time slows to a crawl as the caster character is whisked away to a dizzying plane of close-quartered, moist, womb-like caverns, where is forced to read a text written in the words of his native language but with a recondite meaning utterly beyond his comprehension. Upon completing the invocation, he appears back on his native plane. No time seems to have passed, and he finds himself weakened by whatever extent he sacrificed ability score points for spellburn.' },

If the caster resists, the serpents flee and the spellburn fails. If he does not resist, the serpents suck blood until the spellburn is complete as normal, then they wriggle back into the earth. As they disappear below the ground, one turns its head back to offer thanks from Bobugbubilzâ€¦then it is gone.' }
